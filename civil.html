    <h1>Departments Of Civil Engineering</h1>
    <p>The department of civil engineering was started in the year 1981 with a sanctioned intake of Twenty students. It has so far trained more than 1000 civil engineers who are serving the nation with distinction in public and private organizations in India,
        in addition to a few who have gone abroad. The college took a plunge into the immensely refreshing and challenging field of Civil Engineering with the setting up of the Civil Engineering Department, right from the genesis of the college. The Department
        of Civil Engineering is excellently suited to meet the ever changing requirements of engineers with courses that combine the study of management, business skills and computers with engineering. The department ensures not only that the courses
        are updated, but also that they reflect the current needs of commerce, industry and the society as a whole.</p>
